Database Cleanup Script - Remove Unused Signals
===============================================

This script removes signals from the database that don't have corresponding
trading performance entries. These are signals that were generated but never
actually traded.

Usage:
    python cleanup_unused_signals.py [--dry-run] [--confirm]
    
Options:
    --dry-run    Show what would be deleted without actually deleting
    --confirm    Skip confirmation prompt and proceed with deletion
